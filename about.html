Sanjay and Arvind Seshan, two high school students from FRC 8027, are the founders of this site. They are the primary authors of all the lessons. They have a very strong background in both programming and teaching. They have ten years of experience competing, coaching and judging in FIRST LEGO League. They are the winners of the First Place Programming Award at World Festival in FIRST LEGO League. They are also the Champion's Award winner of World Festival. Their robots have scored top six in the world every year. In addition, they were selected to be one of the "First Five" - five members of the community asked to provide LEGO Education with feedback on SPIKE Prime.

<br><br>
                They also run EV3Lessons.com and FLLTutorials.com. EV3Lessons.com was founded in 2014 to support the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Community and robotics teams. That community grew to over 550,000 users in 175 countries. FLLTutorials focuses on supporting FIRST LEGO League teams and has over 100,000 users.
<br />
                    <br>The Seshan Brothers also like to build and program LEGO robots for fun. These robots have been featured at:
          World Maker Faire (New York, San Francisco), Innovation Faire (St.Louis, Detroit), Pittsburgh Maker Faire, WRO Finals (New Delhi, Costa Rica, Thailand), and Maker Faire Bay Area. Their robots have also been featured on official LEGO YouTube Channel, LEGO Social Media channels as well as publications such as The Verge and Popular Mechanics. <br>

  <h3>Our Mission:</h3>

Our primary mission is to share their knowledge and inspire others.

We want to give robotics students a good starting point for coding well. To accomplish this goal, we provide the building blocks for success, but leave room for you to learn, discover, innovate and solve competition challenges. <br /><br />

We also want to create a community where SPIKE Prime users (FIRST LEGO League teams and individuals) share and learn together. We hope that teams, teachers and community members will contribute lessons, robot designs and translations over time.<br /><br />

Our hope to create a website where SPIKE Prime users can share and learn together. Our intention is to keep all our materials free in the spirit of everyone learning together.
