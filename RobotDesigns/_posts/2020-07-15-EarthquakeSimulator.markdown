This design is built with one SPIKE Prime Core Set (45678). It is designed to be similar to WeDO Robust Structures lesson.
<br>
<br>
Step 1: Build the Earthquake Simulator using the build instructions<br>
Step 2: Create different buildings using available LEGO brick. Two sample builds are provided. Change the height, create wider and narrower bases, and try out different designs.<br>
Step 3: Create a program that varies the shaking of the platform. Note: You can also use the default program on the Hub. When you turn on the hub, select the default Heart program. Press the right button to start the motor. The more you press the right button, the more power the motor will get. <br>
Step 4: Record which building topples first and share your findings.
